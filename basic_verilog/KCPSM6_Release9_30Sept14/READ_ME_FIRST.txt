KCPSM6 : PicoBlaze for Spartan-6, Virtex-6, 7-Series, Zynq and UltraScale Devices 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 9.

Ken Chapman - Xilinx Ltd - 30th September 2014  



Thank you for opening the 'READ_ME_FIRST' file. Don't worry, you really don't have to read all 
of this file before you get started but please do review just this section to understand what 
is being made available to you. I really hope you will have fun using PicoBlaze and I think you
will as long as you set off in the right direction from the outset.  



Welcome to  KCPSM6, the PicoBlaze optimised for Spartan-6, Virtex-6, 7-Series, Zynq and 
UltraScale devices. Whether this is your first experience of PicoBlaze or you have experience of 
the previous versions I hope you will find KCPSM6 useful, and most of all, fun! This package 
also contains optimised UART macros (and PicoTerm) which are ideal for use with PicoBlaze 
especially as so many boards provide a USB/UART interface. Several reference designs are 
included in which KCPSM6 implements simple applications involving UART, I2C, SPI and XADC.

Although KCPSM6 is not difficult to use, it is highly recommended that you take some time to 
look at the documentation. Before you do that, we must consider which Xilinx design tools you
will be using to target which device. As you can see from the table below, you don't always have
a choice, and certainly, only Vivado will support devices released in the future.


        Device                  ISE (14.7)        Vivado (2014.2)

        Spartan-6                  Yes               No 
       
        Virtex-6                   Yes               No
        
        7-Series
            Artix 35/50/75         No                Yes
            Artix 100/200          Yes               Yes
            Kintex                 Yes               Yes
            Virtex                 Yes               Yes
  
        Zynq                       Yes               Yes 
 
        UltraScale                 No                Yes
                  

The KCPSM6 macro is provided in the form of a VHDL or Verilog file. Although you will at some 
point assemble a PSM program for PicoBlaze to execute, the assembler also generates a single
VHDL or Verilog file defining a memory holding your program. As such if you can implement a 
standard HDL design using ISE or Vivado then there is really very little more for you to learn.
In fact, most competent hardware engineers report being able to implement their first design in
less than 2 hours and feeling quite proficient and productive by the end of one day. 

However, it is also recognised that a large number of people using PicoBlaze for the first 
time also have a tendency to be new to the world of FPGA and hardware design. Whilst it is not 
possible or intended for PicoBlaze and this package to be a replacement for all the official 
Xilinx documentation and customer education training materials, it is hoped that there is enough 
information presented in this package to at least get anyone started and able to implement their 
first small but working design that contains PicoBlaze. 


If you will be using the ISE design tools then...

    Open 'KCPSM6_User_Guide_30Sept14.pdf' and the first 30 pages will introduce you to 
    KCPSM6 and take you step by step through the creation of a working PicoBlaze design.
    Once you have done this you will know most of what there is to know about the PicoBlaze 
    design flow and the rest of the document provides you with a manual for you to refer to 
    as you interactively work with PicoBlaze when implementing your own real designs. 
 
    This document does assume that you have a fundamental grasp of HDL design and have used
    ISE before. If you have not, then it is strongly recommended that you first implement a 
    very simple design using ISE. For example, a design that simply connects some switches
    to some LEDs would be enough to prepare you to use PicoBlaze for the first time. Ideally,
    you will have a board that you can download your first design to and see that it works.
    Alternatively, you may choose to directly use one of the reference designs provided in 
    this package as your starting point (i.e. known good VHDL or Verilog code).  

    When this package was released, ISE was version 14.7 and ideally you will be using that 
    version or later. As you will learn when following the documentation, the assembler needs
    a 'ROM_form' template and your default starting template should be a copy of 'ROM_form.vhd' 
    provided in the root directory of the package or 'ROM_form.vhd' contained in the 'Verilog'
    directory. In both cases these are renamed copies of 'ROM_form_JTAGLoader_14March13.vhd' 
    and 'ROM_form_JTAGLoader_14March13.v' respectively. If for some reason you are using ISE
    version 12.x or older then please see 'Known_Issues_and_Workarounds.txt' as you will need 
    to use a different 'ROM_form' template to be compatible with the older version of the tools. 

If you will be using the Vivado design tools then...

    The first 30 pages of 'KCPSM6_User_Guide_30Sept14.pdf' introduce you to KCPSM6 and take
    you through the creation of a PicoBlaze design. Do take a look at these pages to gain an
    appreciation of the PicoBlaze design flow and how to insert and connect KCPSM6 to other
    logic but generally ignore anything specifically to do with the ISE tools because you are
    using Vivado! The rest of this document provides you with a manual for you to refer to 
    as you interactively work with PicoBlaze when implementing your own real designs. 

    Vivado is a relatively new tool and even engineers with years of ISE experience may be 
    faced with using it for the first time. 'PicoBlaze_Design_in_Vivado' is a supplementary
    document that takes one of the reference designs provided in this package and shows you,
    step by step, how to create a Vivado project and a way in which you can create and 
    implement a design containing PicoBlaze. The first page of this document will lead you
    to the relevant material depending on your current familiarity with Vivado and PicoBlaze. 

    When this package was released, Vivado was version 2014.x and ideally you will need to be 
    using a 2014.x version or later. As you will learn when following the documentation, the 
    assembler needs a 'ROM_form' template and your default starting template should be renamed
    copy of 'ROM_form_JTAGLoader_Vivado_2June14.vhd' or 'ROM_form_JTAGLoader_Vivado_2June14.v'.


Regardless of the design tools you are using, this package also includes the following documents.
Please don't feel that you need to read everything before you start (that wouldn't be fun!), but
do take a look at them when you feel like learning a bit more or feel that you may have an issue.

all_kcpsm6_syntax.psm
  Page 52 of 'KCPSM6_User_Guide_30Sept14.pdf' provides a summary of the KCPSM6 Assembler syntax
  and pages 53 to 101 show you all the instructions often with snippets of PSM code as examples.
  'all_kcpsm6_syntax.psm' is NOT a real program but it does contain valid examples of all PSM 
  syntax (i.e. it can be assembled). DO LOOK AT THIS file because it provides comprehensive 
  descriptions of the syntax rules and full details and examples of the assembler directives.
  An understanding of the most basic syntax is adequate for most users and applications. However, 
  there are some quite interesting possibilities that should appeal to anyone that wants to 
  achieve more with PicoBlaze just have more fun with it!

Known_Issues_and_Workarounds.txt 
  Ideally you won't encounter any issues, but if you do, please check this one out 
  and hopefully it will explain what to do.
 
UART6_User_Guide_and_Reference_Designs_30Sept14.pdf
  This document is provided in the 'UART_and_PicoTerm' directory and describes the optimised
  UART macros that can be useful in PicoBlaze designs and used in various reference designs.
  More designs together with their own documentation can be found in the 'Reference Designs' 
  directory.

PicoTerm_README.txt
  A terminal application called 'PicoTerm' with some rather special, and hopefully fun, features
  is also provided in the 'UART_and_PicoTerm' directory. 

kcpsm6_assembler_readme.txt
  The main documentation should have adequately described how to run the assembler to generate 
  VHDL, Verliog and HEX file from your PSM code. If you are someone that likes to write batch
  files to automate the design flow or you just like to know all the details then this document
  is for you.         

The remainder of this 'READ_ME_FIRST.txt' file contains the following sections.

  - Principle Features of KCPSM6
  - System Requirements
  - Package Contents
  - Changes and Additions in each release.
  - Other Useful Stuff?
  - Known Limitations

In most cases PicoBlaze design is easy so go and start having fun. Use the rest of this document 
for clues should you wonder what something is or need to check the details about package contents
of requirements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
System Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Hardware
--------

KCPSM6 is optimised for Spartan-6, Virtex-6 and 7-Series devices. It also maps well to 
UltraScale devices but it can NOT be used with previous generations of device including 
Spartan-3 Generation and Virtex-5. 


JTAG Loader requires a Platform Cable USB or Digilent equivalent JTAG programming solution.
Note that equivalent circuits are often included on development boards and evaluation kits 
rather than as a separate 'pod'. 


Xilinx Design Tools
-------------------

ISE - v13.x or later (ideally v14.7).
      Please see the 'Known_Issues_and_Workarounds.txt' file if using ISE 12.x.

  or
  --

Vivado 2014.x or later 
      Note that JTAG Loader also requires ISE to be installed. 


KCPSM6 Assembler
----------------

Windows operating system for KCPSM6 Assembler and JTAG Loader utility.
   Users have reported that the KCPSM6 Assembler has worked well with both 32-Bit and 64-bit 
   versions of both Windows-XP and Win-7 environments. It has also been successfully used with 
   Wine within a 64-bit Linux environment.   


JTAG Loader Utility
-------------------

JTAG Loader makes use of various drivers associated with ChipScope and forming part of an 
installation of the ISE tools. Therefore you must have ISE installed (even if using Vivado) and
the 'PATH' and 'XILINX' environment variables must be set appropriately so that JTAG Loader can 
locate and use the files that it requires. Below are typical examples of the environment 
variables required when using ISE v14.7. It is possible that they have already been set at the 
system level but check that they accurately reflect your installation. 

PATH = C:\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS\ISE\lib\nt;     (for 32-bit operating systems)
PATH = C:\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS\ISE\lib\nt64;   (for 64-bit operating systems)
XILINX = C:\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS\ISE

As shown on page 25 of 'KCPSM6_User_Guide_30Sept14.pdf' the 'ISE Design Suite Command Prompt'
can be used or you can manually invoke the 'settings32.bat' or 'settings64.bat' provided in 
C:\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS (or equivalent depending on version of ISE) once a command window has been
opened. 

It is often easier and more convenient to permanently define your PATH and XILINX environment 
variables at the system level or to write batch files that temporarily set them before running 
JTAG Loader to load a specified program into the memory.

To permanently set 'System Properties'.... 

 Windows XP...
  Right click on 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'. 
  Go to the 'Advanced' tab and choose 'Environment Variables'. 
  Use 'New' or 'Edit' as necessary.   

 Windows 7...
  Start -> Control Panel -> User Accounts
  Change my environment variables
  Use 'New' or 'Edit' under 'User variables for <username>' as necessary.   

An example batch file (.bat)...

  REM Setting environment variables to define location of ISE v14.7
  PATH=%PATH%;C:\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS\ISE\lib\nt64
  set XILINX=C:\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS\ISE

  REM Upload program HEX using JTAG Loader 
  JTAG_Loader_Win7_64.exe -l my_program.hex

JTAG Loader must also be able to access some system level DLL files. In the case of a Windows-XP
environment then it is normal for the PATH to contain 'C:\WINDOWS\system32;' or similar. So if 
you receive a system error indicating that 'PCMSVCR100.dll' is missing or could not be found then
add the appropriate definition to your PATH. When using a Windows-7 environment it is more likely 
that 'MSVCR100.dll' will become the subject of a system error message. 'MSVCR100.dll' is not part
of a default Windows-7 installation but is a often present as a result of a Microsoft Visual C++
application. If you do encounter this issue then the quickest solution is to place a copy of 
'msvcr100.dll' provided in the 'JTAG_Loader' directory of this package in to the same directory
as the JTAG Loader executable you are invoking.

                                       Presented on the KC705 Kintex-7 Board this design shows
                                       how KCPSM6 can implement I2C communication. In this example,
                                       KCPSM6 is used to control an I2C Bus Switch (PCA9548) in order 
                                       to access the M24C08 EEPROM on the KC705 board. The design can 
                                       be used to read and modify any location in the EEPROM.

                                       Presented on the KC705 Kintex-7 Board this design shows
                                       how KCPSM6 can implement SPI communication. In this example,
                                       KCPSM6 is used to access the N25Q128 Flash memory whose primary 
                                       purpose is holding a configuration image for the Kintex device. 
                                       Hence this design can be used to observe a configuration image 
                                       as well as erase sectors and write any location.

                                       Presented on the KC705 Kintex-7 Board this design shows
                                       KCPSM6 interfaced to ICAPE2, FRAME_ECCE2 and a BRAM memory.
                                       This design will have particular appeal to anyone interested
                                       in SEU, error detection and correction and the SEM IP core.
                                       ICAPE2 can be used for other applications such as MultiBoot
                                       control so the fundamental communication presented will be 
                                       useful for anyone needing to use ICAPE2. The connection of
                                       a BRAM for additional data storage as well as a simple line
                                       editor may have wider appeal to all PicoBlaze users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes and Additions in each release
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Release 1 (30 September 2010)
-----------------------------

Initial public release.


Release 2 (31 March 2011)
-------------------------

kcpsm6.vhd
  Correction to logic used to calculate parity (CARRY flag) during a TEST instruction.
  The specific conditions under which v1.0 would generate an incorrect result were:-
    TEST instruction (not TESTCY).
    The least significant 2 bits of the logical AND register had to be "01".
    The carry flag had to be set before the TEST instruction was executed. 
  The most likely coding style in which the defect in v1.0 would be observed would be...
       TEST s4, 01
       JUMP C, bit0_was_set 
  Even the above code works in v1.0 if the CARRY flag was clear before the TEST instruction.
  Fortunately the most common coding style uses the ZERO flag which works correctly so 
  the alternative code shown below would work perfectly in v1.0 as well...
       TEST s4, 01
       JUMP NZ, bit0_was_set 
   
Additions to ROM_form templates.

  ATLYS Spartan-6 reference design modified to include PicoTerm Virtual Switches.

Reference Designs
  Three new reference designs are presented on the Kintex-7 KC705 board. All build upon the 
  UART reference designs to show how KCPSM6 can implement...   
    a) I2C signalling and transactions (I2C Multiplexer control and EEPROM access).
    b) SPI signalling and transactions (access Flash memory shared with configuration).
    c) an XADC interface and analogue sample value conversions (includes a simple plot of die 
       temperature over time in the PicoTerm Graphic window).
  The source code provided with all designs contains comprehensive descriptions and there is 
  a supporting PDF document providing an overview, images and schematics.  

Documentation 
  General additions, enhancements and corrections to all documentation.


Release 7 (30 September 2013)
-----------------------------

Assembler
  Addition of a 'DEFAULT_JUMP' directive for very high reliability applications.
  Correction to handling of TABLEs containing only one item.

UART and PicoTerm
  PicoTerm v1.94
    Addition of several new DCS commands (see 'PicoTerm_README.txt' for full details)...
       'L' and 'l' to open and close a log file.
       'R' and 'r' to read files.
       'N' to generate and return random numbers.
       'p' to return the version of PicoTerm.
    Support display of British Pound symbol (£ = A3 hex).
    Improved response to mouse clicks when using the Virtual Switches.
     
Reference Designs & Documentation

Known Limitations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DATA2MEM
--------

There are some issues associated with the use of DATA2MEM contained in ISE 12.x and later that 
prevent its use in modifying a KCPSM6 program contained in block memory within Spartan-6 and 
Virtex-6 devices. It is unlikely that this issue will be fixed but a workaround may yet be 
possible to implement. Whenever possible, use JTAG Loader which has the advantage of being much
faster anyway. If you have a requirement to modify more than one KCPSM6 program in the same 
design then please contact us to discuss how this may be achieved using JTAG Loader.

DATA2MEM in ISE 14.5 has been used to successfully to modify the contents of a 2K program in a 
Kintex-7 device. At this time the procedure is manual and needs to be better documented. Please
contact the author of PicoBlaze if you require early access to this information.
