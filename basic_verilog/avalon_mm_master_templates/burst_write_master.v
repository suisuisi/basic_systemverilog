	This bursting write master is passed a word aligned address, length in bytes,
	and a 'go' bit.  The master will continue to post full length bursts until
	the length register reaches a value less than a full burst.  A single final
	burst is then posted when enough data has been buffered and then the done bit
	will be asserted. 

	To use this master you must simply drive the control signals into this block,
	and also write the data to the exposed write FIFO.  To read from the exposed FIFO
	use the 'user_write_buffer' signal to push data into the FIFO 'user_buffer_data'.
	The signal 'user_buffer_full' is asserted whenever the exposed buffer is full.
	You should not attempt to write data to the exposed FIFO if it is full.
