                ; This file contains routines that implement delays in software. It should be recognised
                ; that the delay periods are the result of executing instructions, and because every
                ; instruction takes 2 clock cycles to execute, it is possible to determine the exact
                ; delay period. However, besides the obvious dependency on the clock frequency, it
                ; should also be recognised that any interrupts to KCPSM6 (or use of sleep mode) will
                ; impact the timing. In general, it is better only to use soft delay routines in
                ; situations where approximate timing is adequate; in those situations KCPSM6 will often
                ; exceed your requirements.
